## SECRET TEXT
### a very simple & trivial app to store secret text

The main purpose of this app is to familiarize myself into `Node.js` and `mongodb` environment. and also because I don't trust google-chrome to store all of my __`scientific`__ bookmarks and top tier __`classified research`__ URLs. 


some of the features including as follows :
- Password protected
- Custom URL
- Self Destroy ( using good ol' crontab )
- hackernews theme ( because reasons )

Hopefully, this remains as my personal use on my private server, but __you__ can also make contribution or do whatever you want with this repo. You know the drill.
